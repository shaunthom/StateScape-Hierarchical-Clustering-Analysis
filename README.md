# StateScape-Hierarchical-Clustering-Analysis-of-US-States
In this project, I tried to cluster together various US states on the basis of some features such as Population, Area, Graduation Rate and so on. The results are very good and it shows us that hierarchical clustering is a good branch of K-means clustering. I have also added a plethora of features such as Visualizing the K-means Clustering Results by ggplot, Silhouette Plot to Evaluate K-means Clustering Quality, Elbow Method to Determine the Optimal Number of Clusters for K-means, Creating a Heatmap for State.x77 Data and so on. 

You can check out the codes as it is filled with informative comments!
